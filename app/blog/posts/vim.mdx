It’s wild to think my first year in Systems Design Engineering is already behind me. Looking back, it feels like twelve months packed into one: courses, co-op, student events, and a constant stream of conversations that shaped how I see both engineering and myself.  

## Finding My Place  

Starting out, I leaned on every event and community I could find. Women in Engineering activities and late-night talks with classmates made those first weeks a little less overwhelming. What struck me most was how quickly Waterloo starts throwing you into things—there’s no “warm-up lap.”  

## Organizing Big Things  

One highlight was helping to organize a national coding tournament. We raised over \$7,000 in sponsorships, brought together hundreds of students from across the country, and coordinated with a small army of volunteers. It was hectic, messy, and one of the most rewarding experiences of my year.  

## Learning by Doing  

Academically, it was a crash course in contrast: on one side, abstract topics like data structures and algorithms; on the other, physical circuits, breadboards, and debugging with a multimeter. I also got to dive into human factors and usability—how people actually interact with technology—which is where I feel most at home. Somewhere in the middle of it all, I took on the role of class rep, which gave me another angle on how our little community works.  

## Mentorship and Outreach  

Outside the classroom, I found myself in roles where I was suddenly the one offering advice. Between student shadow days, panels, and mentorship programs, I worked with over a dozen prospective students. Explaining Waterloo life to someone else forced me to reflect on what I was learning myself.  

## First Co-op  

For my first co-op, I landed at NorthGuide, a consulting firm focused on corporate innovation and economic development. It was my first real taste of applying engineering thinking to business problems: messy challenges, limited information, and a need to balance creativity with practicality.  

## Building Community  

One of my favorite parts of the year was simply talking to people—coffee chats with upper years, founders, industry professionals, and peers. Every conversation added a small piece to the puzzle of where I might want to go.  

## What’s Next  

This fall I’ll be joining Rogers on their AI Strategy & Product team, working on real-world GenAI solutions and cross-functional projects. It’s both exciting and a little intimidating, but that seems to be the running theme of this year: lean into the challenge and figure it out along the way.  

## Closing Thoughts  

First year wasn’t smooth, and it definitely wasn’t easy, but it was full of moments that made me grow. If I had to sum it up, I’d say it was about learning to balance chaos with curiosity—whether in a classroom, on a project, or over a cup of coffee.  

Here’s to year two.
